        "If he N-Air/F-Airs your shield, it's still his turn.",
        "Dash attack is insanely laggy. It's ok to drop shield to chase the cross up.",
        "Up-B has a weird launch angle. In general, always hold down and away or risk dying super early.",
        "It's better to spotdodge the third Side-B than block it. You'll get to act faster.",
        "Approaching B-Air is very good in this matchup to get around magic.",
        "Mashing in Buster art means you die to counter at 50. Beware.",
        "Sora is so floaty that some low percent nair combos don't work right. Adjust your strings accordingly.",
        "Against Sora's aerials it's better to swing after him rather than before him because he's floaty.",
        "U-Throw is valid against this character as he's too floaty to contest vertical pressure.",
        "Learn how his recovery works. He will have to Side-B after his Up-B if he isn't close enough. ",
        "Side-B doesn't snap to the ledge immediately until the hitbox is done. You can contest with D-Air on ledge.",
        "Blizzaga loses to shield. Firaga loses to jump, and Thundaga loses to just remaining grounded.",
        "Counter will kill you if you try to use an obvious Backslash to ledge. Be precise and unpredictable with how you recover as he has tons of lethal two-frames and edgeguard options.",
        "Don't try to punish D-Smash with grab. You'll likely just whiff due to the high profile. Air Slash OoS won't work either.",
