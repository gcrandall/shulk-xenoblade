        "Min Min players will often focus on using rising N-Air to catch your jumps (both at close range and when they cover an oos option). Shield and Air Slash on reaction to the rising N-Air. It's important to anticipate this option because it's hard to Up-B on time with only raw reaction.",
        "Her platform pressure is relatively subpar. Use platforms to get some breathing room when your shield is low, and also to recharge arts",
        "Use frontslash in neutral as a way to mix up your landings to force her smash attacks and tilts to whiff.",
        "Her tether is awful; F-Air her once and she dies.",
        "Backslash as a recovery option tends to clank with Min Min's 2-frame options.",
        "Her moves have a ton of lag. Speed art is very good at breaking her zone.",
        "Hitting Min Min with Backslash while she has a tilt out and is walking backwards will register as hitting her back.",
        "Jump Art is critical to have for disadvantage, but it can also make neutral a lot easier. This is our best art in the matchup so be sure to utilize it intelligently.",
        "Prioritize stage control over damage."
